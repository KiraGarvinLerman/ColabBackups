# Ologies Podcast Analysis Portfolio Piece

## Overview

Welcome to my portfolio piece focused on analyzing the *Ologies* podcast. This document outlines my approach to understanding the relationship between podcast topics and public interest as reflected in search trends. 

**Status: Work In Progress (WIP)**  
This project is currently in the process of being developed, with the first step nearing completion. I aim to provide a comprehensive analysis that not only showcases my technical skills but also delivers insights into the podcast's impact on public interest.

## Approach

### 1. Scrape Ologies Episodes
- Utilize [BeautifulSoup](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Google_Trends_API.ipynb) to extract details about the episodes of the Ologies podcast. This includes:
  - Episode titles
  - Air dates
  - Keywords covered

### 2. Gather Search Trend Data
- Leverage [Pytrends](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Tanu-N-Prabhu/Python/blob/master/Google_Trends_API.ipynb) to collect data on search trends related to the topics discussed in the Ologies episodes.

### 3. Analyze Correlation
- Compare the trends in the search data with the topics covered in the Ologies podcast episodes. Look for patterns or correlations to determine if there’s a relationship between the podcast topics and the public’s interest as reflected in search data.
